# Plenoptic experiments

Miscellaneous scripts to better understand plenoptic, to help the development of the library.

These scripts may be helpful to others, but are primarily intended for internal use. As such, they've been developed for use on the Flatiron Institute's SLURM cluster, and make use of Flatiron's [disBatch](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/disBatch) tool to submit many jobs at once.

They are also written at a single point of time and not maintained, so they are not future-proof. I have attempted to include the specific commits when they are run.
