# PS LBFGS

Investigations into using the LBFGS optimizer for PortillaSimoncelli texture synthesis. See [issue #365](https://github.com/plenoptic-org/plenoptic/issues/365) for more details.

The summary directories were created by `summarize.py` for the different experiments. At the time, that file was not under version control, so some of the directories contain a copy of that script at the time. (As such, `summarize.py` should only be expected to work for the most recent experiment, `history_size`.)

Each summary directory also contains `all_loss.csv`, summarizing that particular experiment, and some plots used to understand it.
